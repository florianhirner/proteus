# Proteus

This is a repository for the paper "Proteus: A Pipelined NTT Architecture Generator". 

It include a tool to generate parametric Radix-2 Single-path Delay Feedback (SDF) and Multi-path Delay Commutator (MDC) architectures for FPGAs.

This repository provides the source code of Proteus, a tool to generate parametric Radix-2 Single-path Delay Feedback (SDF) and Multi-path Delay Commutator (MDC) architectures for FPGAs.

All content of this repo is for academic research use only. It does not come with any support, warranty, or responsibility.

# Structure of this Repo

The repository is structured into two main folders, namly `toolchain` and `vivado_projects`. The first folder `toolchain` contains all source code file to generate test vectors via python (`toolchain`) as well as all Verilog/SystemVerilog files required to generate a Radix-2 SDF or MDC architecture (`hw`). The second folder `vivado_projects` contains the project-files for Radix-2 SDF and MDC for all of the  

# Running Proteus

## Run python scripts

We prepared a toolchain that can be used to verify the functionality of the generated hardware. To generate you own testcases for a certain architecture and option you need to execute:

``
/bin/python3 /home/fhirner/Desktop/proteus/toolchain/py/ntt_demo.py <NTT_TYPE> <RADIX_TYPE> <OP> <LOGN> <LOGQ> <REDUCTION_TYPE>
``

In case of Radix-2 MDC OP 5 with a polynomial size of 2^4 and a coefficient size of 64 bit that uses an addshift modular reduction; use: 

``
/bin/python3 /home/fhirner/Desktop/proteus/toolchain/py/ntt_demo.py NORMAL MDC 5 4 64 ADDSHIFT
``


## Run vivado projects

We already prepared vivado project for each option of Proteus to simplify usage. You first have to source all vivado related scipts via 

``
source /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2019.1/settings64.sh
source /opt/Xilinx/SDK/2019.1/settings64.sh
``

After sourcing all related scripts you need to start with the appropriate project file. This can be done by using:  

``
vivado -source vivado_projects/sdf/ntt_op_1_2/project_1/project_1.xpr
``

The command above starts vivado with Radix-2 SDF option 1 and 2, which can take up to a few second. Now you can either start a simulation, synthesis, or implementation run. If you want to use the testcases generated by the tool chain to verify the behavior you just need to click `Run Simulation` on the left toolbar of vivado. This will open a simulation form that runs the simulation behaivor. We already prepared a waveform to simplify the process.
